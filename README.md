A password generator from a quote made with flutter. It aims at creating
complicated passwords that you can easily remember.

## Exemple

> Treat your password like your toothbrush. Get a new one every six months.

> 3678

## How does it work ?

It gets every first letter of the quote, search for any recurrent letter and
inserts the number you provided. So you only have to remember your favorite
quote and number to have a very strong password ğŸ”’.
